# FamilyBASICPrograms
Repository of Family BASIC Programs. All are coded by me.

# Usage
All .bas files are created in Vim. As such, any general purpose text editor will do. To run these files, open them and type them into your favorite NES/Famicom emulator, or a real Famicom BASIC hardware setup. As the files rely on the syntax present for Family BASIC, I cannot guarantee cross compatibility with other BASIC interpreters, such as Commodore BASIC, Integer BASIC, or any other BASIC derivative.
